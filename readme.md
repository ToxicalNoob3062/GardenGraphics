#The Virtual Garden

Welcome to the Virtual Garden, a project that beautifully combines the worlds of programming, mathematics, and nature.

## Overview

In this project, we've created a digital garden where plants grow naturally, sway with the wind, and are chased by butterflies. It's a perfect blend of physics, mathematics, biology, and logic.

## Key Concepts

This project heavily utilizes two key mathematical concepts: Bezier curves and angle rotations.

### Bezier Curves

Bezier curves are a mathematical tool used in computer graphics to draw shapes. In our garden, we've used Bezier curves to model the growth and movement of the plants and butterflies. While understanding the complex mathematics behind Bezier curves isn't necessary to appreciate the garden, those interested can find a wealth of resources online.

### Angle Rotations

Angle rotations are another mathematical concept we've used to bring our garden to life. They help us simulate the natural movement of the plants and butterflies, adding a touch of realism to our virtual world.

## Code Readability

We've made every effort to ensure the code is as readable as possible. Each method is accompanied by comments explaining what it does and how it uses Bezier equations. We believe that even a first-year student could follow along!

## Enjoy the View

We invite you to sit back and enjoy the view of our virtual garden. Watch as the plants grow and sway, and the butterflies chase each other. It's a testament to the beauty that can be created when physics, maths, biology, and logic come together.
